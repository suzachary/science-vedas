  	<h2>Citations/Works Cited Page</h2>
  	<p>
  		<h3>In-Text Citations</h3>
  		If the author is known, put the author's name and the page number of the source in parentheses. If no author is known, put the name of the source instead. If there are multiple authors, list both names. For electronic sources, no page number is required.
  			<br><br>
  		Example: Human beings have been described as "symbol-using animals" <strong>(Burke 3)</strong>.</p>
  		<br><br>
  		<h3>Works Cited Page</h3>
  		<p>When citing works, list information in this order:
  			<ol>
  			  <li>Author</li>
  			  <li>Title of Source</li>
  			  <li>Title of Container</li>
  			  <li>Other Contributors</li>
  			  <li>Version</li>
  			  <li>Number</li>
  			  <li>Publisher</li>
  			  <li>Publication Date</li>
  			  <li>Location</li>
  		    </ol>
  		    While it is perfectly fine to not have all of the requested information, it is best to include as much information as possible.
